# Obsidian-Mastodon-Templates
Obsidian MD Templater Templates for interacting with Mastodon posts.  Please note that to do this, these templates will 
make REST requests out to the Mastodon instance the post is from.

I'm making these available under the AGPL, which is the same license Templater uses (at the time of this writing).
Suggestions for improvements are welcome.

Please note, I banged this out in an afternoon, and I know basically zero javascript.  I do not promise these aren't
doing something dumb.

## How to use
- Install [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
- Copy the two templates into your templates directory
- Enjoy

## What's the difference between the two templates?
- The `L-mastodon-status` template is intended to be used in an existing note to insert the contents of a mastodon post.
- The `P-mastodon-status` template is meant to be used on a new page, and will fill in some sections and rename the page.
